# Hexadecimal Kaprekar & Collatz Analysis
Research into base-16 number anomalies and iterative dynamical systems.

## 1. Hexadecimal Kaprekar Numbers
This repository contains the first exhaustive search for integers $n$ such that $n^2$ in hexadecimal can be split and summed to $n$. 
**Status:** Pending OEIS Submission.

## 2. Collatz Parity Drift
A statistical analysis of the 3n+1 conjecture. By calculating the geometric mean of multipliers, we identified an "Entropy Bias" of $\approx 0.68$, demonstrating why the sequence structurally decays toward 1.

## How to use
Run `search.sage` in a SageMath environment (like CoCalc) to replicate the results.
